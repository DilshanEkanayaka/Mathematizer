C++ Program to Calculate Power of a Number

In this article, you will learn to compute power to a number manually, and by using pow() function.

This program takes two numbers from the user (a base number and an exponent) and calculates the power.

Power of a number = base^exponent

The above technique works only if the exponent is a positive integer.

If you need to find the power of a number with any real number as an exponent, you can use pow() function.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int exponent;
    float base, result = 1;

    cout << "Enter base and exponent respectively:  ";
    cin >> base >> exponent;

    cout << base << "^" << exponent << " = ";

    while (exponent != 0) {
        result *= base;
        --exponent;
    }

    cout << result;
    
    return 0;
}
